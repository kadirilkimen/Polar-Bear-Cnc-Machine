Read the description >,,,,"Almost all 3D print parts on the x axis will change on the version 1. Current parts are working fine. But the belt’s position will change and it requires to redesign all related parts. Also some parts require too much post work, which is not nice and they needed to be re-designed."
Belt-end-clamp,1,,STLs/x-axis/belt-end-clamp.stl,This part designed on the way. It’s not intended to be a final design part.
tool-adapter-cap,1,,STLs/x-axis/tool-adapter/tool-adapter-cap.stl,This part designed on the way. It’s not intended to be a final design part.
tool-adapter-body,1,,STLs/x-axis/tool-adapter/tool-adapter-body.stl,This part must be as accurate as possible. Print it slow with 0.1mm layer height
tool-plug-template,1,,STLs/x-axis/tool-adapter/tool-plug-template.stl,Don’t print this model right away. Instead use it to design your own tool holder
Tool-adapter-t-nut-brick,1,,STLs/x-axis/tool-adapter/tool-adapter-t-nut-brick.stl,This is an M3 nut wrap that prevents the nut from rotating freely.
tool-locking-shoe,1,,STLs/x-axis/tool-adapter/tool-locking-shoe.stl,This part applies force to the tool plug to keep it pressed to the Socket. It does it’s job perfectly. But it’s design is not good and it stucks in position. It changed on v1.
