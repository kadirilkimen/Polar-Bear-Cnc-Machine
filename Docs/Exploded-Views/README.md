## Important ##
### These exploded views may not contain all required elements ###

Since the polarBear is still a prototype, I don't have any instructions or documentation for assembly.

If you are building the prototype version, these exploded views may help you to assemble it.

I am already working on version 1. Once the V1 is ready, I will publish documents, instructions and videos.
